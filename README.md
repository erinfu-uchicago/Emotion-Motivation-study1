# Emotion-Motivation-study1
This is the repo for study1 of Emotion and motivation paper. This is also the repo that used for R course temperately (now: AS1.1).

## AS1.2

I already installed tidyverse and papaja

I already created an R script file

I already created an R Notebook with the Papaja template

**update after the class**

I edited and renamed the R script file to see if could solve the knitting problem I faced when using the papaja template for knitting. The problem wasn't fixed, and I still cannot knit the Rmd file if it contains a "source" code. (keep updating)

I added one "option" code at the beginning of R script file to solve the knitting problem. The problem fixed. (end)
