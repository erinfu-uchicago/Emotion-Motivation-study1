Within this line of thinking, a rich array of positive emotions enable the formation and negotiation of these relationships. Guided by these arguments, we synthesize how top-down confirmatory studies and data-driven, computational studies converge on evidence for 11 positive emotions with distinct experience, expression, and physiology. This taxonomy includes amusement, awe, compassion, contentment, desire, love, joy, interest, pride, relief, and triumph. We conclude by considering how recent taxonomic efforts will advance emotion science in mapping the distinct forms and functions of the positive emotions.},

Fredrickson's (1998, 2001) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions asserts that people's daily experiences of positive emotions compound over time to build a variety of consequential personal resources. The authors tested this build hypothesis in a field experiment with working adults (n = 139), half of whom were randomly-assigned to begin a practice of loving-kindness meditation. Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.

In general, the appraisals accurately classified the positive emotions at rates above chance levels, and the appraisal–emotion relationships conformed to predictions. Also, the appraisals were largely judged by participants as relevant to their positive emotion experiences, and the appraisal–emotion relationships were largely consistent across the two countries.},

	abstract = {Despite great advances in scientific understanding of emotional processes in the last decades, research into the communication of emotions has been constrained by a strong bias toward negative affective states. Typically, studies distinguish between different negative emotions, such as disgust, sadness, anger, and fear. In contrast, most research uses only one category of positive affect, “happiness,” which is assumed to encompass all positive emotional states. This article reviews recent research showing that a number of positive affective states have discrete, recognizable signals. An increased focus on cues other than facial expressions is necessary to understand these positive states and how they are communicated; vocalizations, touch, and postural information offer promising avenues for investigating signals of positive affect. A full scientific understanding of the functions, signals, and mechanisms of emotions requires abandoning the unitary concept of happiness and instead disentangling positive emotions.},

	abstract = {The Duchenne smile hypothesis is that smiles that include eye constriction (AU6) are the product of genuine positive emotion, whereas smiles that do not are either falsified or related to negative emotion. This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion.},

Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found.

In Studies 1 and 2, ratings of charisma in a natural work setting were linked to leaders' positive emotional expressions. In Study 3, leaders' positive emotional expressions were linked to mood states of simulated followers. Results suggest that mood contagion may be one of the psychological mechanisms by which charismatic leaders influence followers. In Study 4, we used a trained actor and manipulated leaders' positive emotional expressions to isolate the effects of positive emotions from the potential effects of non-emotional aspects of effective leadership (e.g., vision, other inspirational influence processes). A positive link between leader emotions and follower mood was found. Results also indicate that both leaders' positive emotional expressions and follower mood influenced ratings of leader effectiveness and attraction to the leader.},

Positive emotions are associated with a range of beneficial outcomes, including longevity, reduced incidents of stroke, improved sleep quality, larger social networks, increased prosocial behavior, lower cortisol levels, and increased endogenous opioids and oxytocin. Despite these benefits, only limited research has focused on understanding positive emotion regulation within the context of depression. Rather, mechanisms related to the regulation of negative emotion have been the focus of research and evidence-based treatments. This interdisciplinary review article aims to advance knowledge regarding the role of positive emotion regulation in individuals with depression to inform the development of transdiagnostic evidenced-based approaches to treatment that bolster the experience of positive life events. We drew on research findings across the fields of clinical psychology, affective science, and social psychology to identify future directions for novel interdisciplinary translational research regarding mechanisms associated with positive emotion regulation.

This is followed by an introduction to online learning along with definitions, discussion of foundational online learning concepts and contemporary pedagogical approaches used in online learning environments. Next, the reasons why motivation is an essential consideration in online teaching and learning contexts are explored. Then, existing research into motivation to learn in online environments is discussed in light of contemporary theoretical motivation frameworks. Finally, self-determination theory (SDT)—an intrinsic-extrinsic theory of motivation—is discussed in detail. In particular, the continuum of human motivation that outlines a range of different types of extrinsic motivation and the underlying psychological concepts of autonomy, competence and relatedness that SDT is built on are discussed. In doing so, justification for the use of SDT as the conceptual framework for this work is provided.},

	abstract = {Motivating the learner to learn is pertinent to curriculum implementation. This is because motivation is an influential factor in the teaching-learning situations. The success of learning depends on whether or not the learners are motivated. Motivation drives learners in reaching learning goals. It is important to recognize the fact that motivating learning is a central element of good teaching. This implies that learners’ motivation is probably the single most important element of learning. Learning is inherently hard work; it is pushing the brain to its limits, and thus can only happen with motivation. Students’ motivation to learn is of special importance because students’ mere presence in the class is of course, not a guarantee that students want to learn. It is only a sign that students live in a society where children are required to attend school. Highly motivated learners are likely to learn readily, and make any class fun to teach, while unmotivated learners may likely learn very little and generally make teaching painful and frustrating. Since modern education is compulsory, teachers cannot take learners’ motivation for granted, and they have a responsibility to ensure learners are motivated to learn. Teachers must persuade learners to want to do what they ought to do. This task— understanding and therefore influencing learners’ motivations to learn—is the thrust of this article. In order to ensure that the aims and objective of the curriculum is achieved, this article focuses on providing the teachers and educators with insight to the concept and types of motivation, motives as a goal, factors affecting motivation, importance of motivation, and strategies for motivating the learners.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTS Dimensions of children's motivation for reading and their relations to reading activity and reading achievement This study was designed to assess dimensions of reading motivation and examine how these dimensions related to students' reading activity and achievement. A heterogeneous urban sample of fifth- and sixth-grade children completed the Motivation for Reading Questionnaire (MRQ; Wigfield \& Guthrie, 1997), a questionnaire designed to assess 11 possible dimensions of reading motivation, including self-efficacy, several types of intrinsic and extrinsic reading motives, social aspects of reading, and the desire to avoid reading. The students also completed several different measures of reading activity and reading achievement. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the proposed dimensions of children's reading motivation could be identified and measured reliably. Scales based on the different dimensions related positively to one another and negatively to the desire to avoid reading. Mean scale scores on most of the dimensions differed by gender and ethnicity, with girls and African Americans reporting stronger motivation. Mean scale scores on most of the dimensions were similar for fifth- and sixth-grade students and for low and middle income students. All of the scales related to children's reports of their reading activity and several to their reading achievement. The strength of the relations between reading motivation and reading achievement was greater for girls and for white students. Cluster analyses revealed seven distinct groupings of children based on their motivational profiles that were related to reading activity and, to a lesser extent, to reading achievement. The study demonstrates that reading motivation is multidimensional and should be regarded as such in research and in practice. Dimensiones de las motivaciones de los niños para la lectura y sus relaciones con la actividad lectora y los logros en lectura ESTE ESTUDIO fue diseñado para evaluar dimensiones de motivación para la lectura y examinar cómo esas dimensiones se relacionan con la actividad lectora y los logros en lectura de los estudiantes. Una muestra urbana heterogénea de niños de quinto y sexto grado completó el Cuestionario de Motivación para la Lectura (MRQ; Wigfield \& Guthrie, 1997), un cuestionario diseñado para evaluar 11 posibles dimensiones de la motivación para la lectura, incluyendo auto-eficacia, varios tipos de motivos intrínsecos y extrínsecos para leer, aspectos sociales de la lectura y el deseo de evitar la lectura. Los estudiantes también completaron varias medidas diferentes de actividad lectora y logros en lectura. Los análisis factoriales demostraron que las dimensiones propuestas de la motivación de los niños para la lectura pueden ser identificadas y medidas en forma confiable. Las escalas basadas en las diferentes dimensiones se relacionaron positivamente una con otra y negativamente con el deseo de evitar la lectura. Las medias de los valores de las escalas en la mayoría de las dimensiones variaron por género y raza, se reportó mayor motivación para las niñas y los afroamericanos. Las medias de los valores de las escalas en la mayoría de las dimensiones fueron similares para los estudiantes de quinto y sexto grado y para los estudiantes de ingresos bajos y medios. Todas las escalas se relacionaron con los informes de los niños acerca de sus actividades lectoras y muchas de ellas con los logros en lectura. La fuerza de las relaciones entre la motivación para la lectura y los logros en lectura fue mayor entre las niñas y los estudiantes blancos. Los análisis por clusters revelaron siete agrupamientos distintos de los niños basados en sus perfiles motivacionales que se relacionaron con la actividad lectora y, en menor grado, con los logros en lectura. El estudio demuestra que la motivación para la lectura es multidimensional y debe ser concebida como tal en la investigación y la práctica. Umfang der Motivation von Kindern zum Lesen und ihre Beziehungen zur Leseaktivität und Leseleistung DIESE STUDIE war darauf ausgelegt, die Ausmaße an Motivationen zum Lesen zu begutachten und zu untersuchen wie diese Dimensionen sich auf die Leseaktivität und den Leistungserfolg der Schüler bezogen. Ein heterogener Querschnitt von Großstadtkindern der fünften und sechsten Klasse vervollständigt den Fragebogen über die Motivation zum Lesen (MRQ; Wigfield \& Guthrie, 1997), ein Fragebogen, der darauf zugeschnitten war, 11 mögliche Ausmaße zur Lesemotivation, einschließlich der eigenen Leistungsfähigkeit, zu beurteilen, sowie mehrere Arten von intrinsischen und extrinsischen Lesemotivationen, sozialen Aspekten des Lesens, und den Wunsch das Lesen zu meiden. Die Schüler vervollständigten auch mehrere unterschiedliche Bewertungsmaßnahmen von Leseaktivitäten und Leseleistungen. Analysen von Zustimmungsfaktoren zeigten an, daß die vorgeschlagenen Dimensionen an Lesemotivation der Kinder zuverlässig identifiziert und gemessen werden konnten. Bewertungsmaßstäbe basierend auf die unterschiedlichen Ausmaße konnten positiv zueinander in Bezug gebracht werden und negativ mit dem Wunsch, das Lesen zu vermeiden. Die durchschnittlichen Werte in der Bemessungsskala bei den meisten Ausmaßen unterschieden sich nach Geschlecht und ethnischer Zugehörigkeit, dabei wurde bei Mädchen und Afroamerikanern von einer stärkeren Motivation berichtet. Die Durchnittsbemessungswerte in den meisten Dimensionen bei Schülern der fünften und sechsten Klasse und bei Schülern aus unteren und mittleren Einkommensschichten waren sich ähnlich. Alle Bemessungswerte bezogen sich auf Schülerberichte über ihre Leseaktivität und einige auf ihre Leseleistung. Die Stärke der Beziehungen zwischen Lesemotivation und Leseleistung war bei den Mädchen und den weißen Schülern größer. Gruppenanalysen zeigten sieben auffällige Gruppierungen von Kindern basierend auf ihre Motivationsprofile, die sich auf Leseaktivität bezogen und, in geringerem Maße, auf die Leseleistung. Die Studie zeigt, daß die Lesemotivation vielschichtig ist und daher als solche in Forschung und Praxis angesehen werden sollte. Dimensions de la motivation des enfants pour la lecture et relations avec l'activité de lecture et les résultats obtenus CETTE RECHERCHE a été effectuée pour évaluer les dimensions de la motivation à la lecture et pour examiner comment elles sont corrélées à l'activité de lecture des élèves et aux résultats qu'ils obtiennent. Un échantillon hétérogène d'enfants de cinquième et sixième année vivant en ville a rempli le Questionnaire de Motivation pour la Lecture (MRQ, Wigfield \& Guthrie, 1997), questionnaire destiné à évaluer 11 dimensions éventuelles de motivation pour la lecture, notamment l'efficacité de soi, plusieurs types intrinsèques et extrinsèques de mobiles de lecture, des aspects sociaux de la lecture, et le désir d'éviter de lire. Les élèves ont aussi fourni plusieurs mesures différentes d'activité de lecture et de résultats obtenus. Une analyse factorielle de confirmation a démontré que les dimensions de la motivation des enfants pour la lecture peuvent être identifiées et mesurées fidèlement. Des échelles basées sur les différentes dimensions sont corrélées positivement entre elles et négativement au désir d'éviter de lire. Pour la plupart des dimensions, les scores moyens des échelles sont différents selon le genre et l'ethnicité, les filles et les Afro-américains manifestant une plus forte motivation. Pour la plupart des dimensions, les scores moyens des échelles sont semblables en cinquième et sixième année, et pour les élèves de milieux aux revenus inférieur ou moyen. Toutes les échelles sont corrélées aux rapports faits par les enfants sur leur activité de lecture et plusieurs aux résultats obtenus. La force des corrélations entre la motivation pour la lecture et les résultats obtenus est plus forte dans le cas des filles et des blancs. L'analyse par clusters fait apparaître sept groupes distincts d'élèves en fonction de leur profil motivationnel qui sont corrélés à l'activité de lecture et, à un moindre degré, aux résultats obtenus. Cette recherche montre que la motivation pour la lecture est multidimensionnelle et devrait être considérée en tant que telle dans la recherche et dans la pratique.},

	abstract = {This study examined the extent to which observed teaching practices and self-reported teacher stress predict children’s learning motivation and phonological awareness in kindergarten. The pre-reading skills of 1,268 children were measured at the beginning of their kindergarten year. Their learning motivation and phonological awareness were assessed in the following spring. Questionnaires measuring teacher stress were filled out by 137 kindergarten teachers. A pair of trained observers used the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (Pianta et al. 2008) to observe 49 kindergarten teachers from the whole sample on their emotional support, classroom organization, and instructional support. The results of multilevel modeling showed that low teacher stress and high classroom organization predicted high learning motivation in children and that the children’s learning motivation contributed to their level of phonological awareness. Moreover, children’s learning motivation mediated the association between teacher stress and children’s phonological awareness. The results emphasize the importance of teachers’ pedagogical well-being and classroom organizational quality for children’s learning motivation.},

This provides the background for the present study, a meta-analysis on the relationship between academic achievement and motivational factors (motivation, self-concept, and self-esteem), emotional factors (emotional intelligence, emotional competence, and emotional well-being), and social factors (social intelligence, social competence, and social skills) in children aged 6–12 years (37 samples, n = 15,777). The methodology based on the PRISMA protocols was applied: phases of inclusion and exclusion of articles, analysis of effect size, heterogeneity, publication bias, and, finally, meta-regressions and moderation analysis. The results showed a moderate positive effect size (0.321) for motivational and social factors (0.210) and a small positive effect size (0.172) for emotional factors. The moderating effects of age (65\% on social factors) and geographical area (52\% on motivational factors, 17\% on emotional factors, and 76\% on social factors) were studied. These results highlight the importance of motivational and social factors regarding academic achievement. In addition, along with the moderating effect of age, that of geographical area emerges strongly given the diversity of contexts studied. Our results highlight the importance that these factors have on academic performance and, therefore, the need to design school plans that address the correct development of these variables.},

By means of a longitudinal design the authors sought to determine the role of students’ self-determined motivation in reducing the intention to drop out of high school over time, while taking into account the impact of academic performance and of socioeconomic status. The effects of students’ self-efficacy and perceived support from parents and teachers were examined. A total of 426 students of grades 9–13 completed self-report estimates and their official school grades were also taken into consideration. Results showed that the level of self-determined motivation in students, which was directly related to the perception of teachers’ autonomy support, was the best predictor of the intention to drop out of school. Self-efficacy had a significant impact both on self-determined motivation and academic performance.},

	abstract = {Few studies in medical education have studied effect of quality of motivation on performance. Self-Determination Theory based on quality of motivation differentiates between Autonomous Motivation (AM) that originates within an individual and Controlled Motivation (CM) that originates from external sources. To determine whether Relative Autonomous Motivation (RAM, a measure of the balance between AM and CM) affects academic performance through good study strategy and higher study effort and compare this model between subgroups: males and females; students selected via two different systems namely qualitative and weighted lottery selection. Data on motivation, study strategy and effort was collected from 383 medical students of VU University Medical Center Amsterdam and their academic performance results were obtained from the student administration. Structural Equation Modelling analysis technique was used to test a hypothesized model in which high RAM would positively affect Good Study Strategy (GSS) and study effort, which in turn would positively affect academic performance in the form of grade point averages. This model fit well with the data, Chi square = 1.095, df = 3, p = 0.778, RMSEA model fit = 0.000. This model also fitted well for all tested subgroups of students. Differences were found in the strength of relationships between the variables for the different subgroups as expected. In conclusion, RAM positively correlated with academic performance through deep strategy towards study and higher study effort. This model seems valid in medical education in subgroups such as males, females, students selected by qualitative and weighted lottery selection.},

	abstract = {With a view to understand the influence of culture on achievement motivation, the study aimed to test the hypothesized mediating role of individual-oriented and social-oriented achievement motives in linking value orientations (e.g. achievement, security, conformity, hedonism) to achievement goals (i.e. mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals) as predictors of English and mathematics achievements. These hypothesized relationships were tested in the one-path analytic model with a sample of Indonesian high-school students (n = 356; 46\% girls, M age = 16.20 years). The findings showed that security and conformity values positively predicted social-oriented achievement motive; self-direction values positively predicted individual-oriented achievement motive; and hedonism values negatively predicted both achievement motive orientations. Both individual-oriented and social-oriented achievement motives positively predicted mastery-approach and performance-approach goals. Interestingly, social-oriented achievement motive also positively predicted mastery-avoidance and performance-avoidance goals, which in turn, negatively predicted English and mathematic achievement. There was also some evidence for the direct effects of values on performance-approach goals and achievement. Taken together, the findings evinced the relevance of achievement goal constructs to Indonesian students and the psychometric properties of the Indonesian version of the Achievement Goals Questionnaire for further use in Indonesia. The study concludes that the meanings of academic motivation and achievement should be seen from a sociocultural perspective relevant to the context in which they are being studied.},

Although, as expected, the growth mindset intervention did interact with incentive systems and prior achievement to influence subsequent academic performance, the existing growth mindset framework cannot fully account for the observed effects. Specifically, we found that the growth mindset intervention did facilitate performance through persistence, but only when the incentive system imparted individuals with a sense of autonomy. Such a facilitation effect was only found among those students who had high prior achievement, but not among those who had underperformed. When the incentive did not impart a sense of autonomy, the growth mindset intervention undermined the performance of those who had high initial achievement. To reconcile these discrepancies and to advance understanding of the impacts of psychological interventions on achievement outcomes, we discuss how the existing theory can be extended and integrated with an identity-based motivation framework (Oyserman \& Destin, 2010). We also discuss the implications of our work for future research and practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Papers addressing the role which human motivation plays in a wide range of specialties including clinical psychology, internal medicine, sports psychology, social psychology, and educational psychology. Over the past twenty years an increasing number of researchers from various universities have been investigating motivational issues underlying the self-regulation of behavior. Using either Self-Determination Theory or closely related theoretical perspectives, these researchers have performed laboratory experiments, as well as field studies in a variety of real-world settings, including education, work, parenting, health care, sport, and protection of the environment. In April 1999 thirty of these researchers convened at the University of Rochester to present their work, share ideas, and discuss future research directions. The Handbook of Self-Determination Research is an outgrowth of that important and fascinating conference. It summarizes the research programs of these social, personality, clinical, developmental, and applied psychologists who have a shared belief in the importance of self-determination for understanding basic motivational processes and for solving pressing real-world problems. Eighteen chapters, including an overview of self-determination theory, present the current state of the research in this scientifically rigorous, yet highly relevant, approach to studying motivational problems in various life domains. Researchers from eighteen universities in the United States, Canada, and Germany present concise and up-to-date accounts of their research programs concerned with the self-determination of human behavior. In these chapters, scholars also consider the relevance of the research on self-determination to other areas of inquiry such as coping, self-esteem, and interest.  Edward L. Deci and Richard Ryan are professors of psychology in the University of Rochester's Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology.},

Three orientations—autonomy, control, and impersonal—are measured by the three subscales of the instrument. Individuals are given a score on each orientation, thus allowing the use of the theoretically appropriate subscale (or, in some cases, a combination of subscales) to predict affects, cognitions, and behaviors. The scale was shown to have internal consistency and temporal stability. The orientations were shown to fit appropriately into a nomological network of constructs and to relate to various behaviors that were hypothesized to be theoretically relevant.},

The meta-analysis (Study 1) pointed toward a potentially important role of intrinsic motivation in predicting school achievement. Three empirical studies of high school and college students in Canada (Studies 2 and 3) and in Sweden (Study 4) showed that intrinsic motivation was the only motivation type to be consistently positively associated with academic achievement over a one-year period, controlling for baseline achievement. Amotivation was significantly associated with lower academic achievement in Studies 3 and 4. Interestingly, intrinsic motivation was also associated with reduced amotivation in two of our studies and it was reciprocally associated with higher school achievement in another study. Overall, our findings highlight the unique importance of intrinsic motivation for the future academic success of high school and college students.},

Consistent with theoretical predictions, intercorrelations among measures of identification with academics, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation were all positive, as were the correlations of those three variables with meaningful cognitive engagement. Those three variables were also negatively correlated with a measure of amotivation and not related to a measure of extrinsic motivation.

	abstract = {The term autonomy literally refers to regulation by the self. Its opposite, heteronomy, refers to controlled regulation, or regulation that occurs without self-endorsement. At a time when philosophers and economists are increasingly detailing the nature of autonomy and recognizing its social and practical significance, many psychologists are questioning the reality and import of autonomy and closely related phenomena such as will, choice, and freedom. Using the framework of self-determination theory (Ryan \& Deci, 2000), we review research concerning the benefits of autonomous versus controlled regulation for goal performance, persistence, affective experience, quality of relationships, and well-being across domains and cultures. We also address some of the controversies and terminological issues surrounding the construct of autonomy, including critiques of autonomy by biological reductionists, cultural relativists, and behaviorists. We conclude that there is a universal and cross-developmental value to autonomous regulation when the construct is understood in an exacting way.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the current study is to examine the relationships between need satisfaction, motivation, and outcomes as well as the differential effects of the three psychological needs. The sample consisted of 1549 students from 10 secondary schools in Singapore. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis showed that students’ psychological needs are positively related to autonomous motivation, and this in turn, lead to higher enjoyment, value and lower pressure. On the other hand, the three psychological needs were negatively related to controlled motivation. Controlled motivation was positively related to pressure but negatively related to enjoyment and value. In terms of the differential effects of the three psychological needs, relatedness contributed strongly to autonomous motivation, compared to autonomy and competence. In contrast, while autonomy and relatedness contributed to controlled motivation negatively, competence positively predicted controlled motivation. Finally, competence was found to link to pressure in a negative way. In summary, the ﬁndings of the current study provide support to the propositions of SDT and add some insight to the differential effects of the three psychological needs.},

This assumption was investigated in an experimental study where 95 participants had to learn a computer task. During the learning phase, we manipulated autonomy, distinguishing among no, moderate, and full autonomy. The results revealed that, when learning a task, having autonomy is preferred to having no autonomy. However, increases in autonomy beyond a certain level (i.e., full versus moderate autonomy) will not yield additional advantages regarding the motivation to learn and learning outcomes, and may have disadvantages in terms of learning efficiency.},

Trained observers rated teachers' instructional styles and students' behavioral engagement in 133 public high school classrooms in the Midwest, and 1,584 students in Grades 9–11 reported their subjective engagement. Correlational and hierarchical linear modeling analyses showed 3 results: (a) Autonomy support and structure were positively correlated, (b) autonomy support and structure both predicted students' behavioral engagement, and (c) only autonomy support was a unique predictor of students' self-reported engagement. We discuss, first, how these findings help illuminate the relations between autonomy support and structure as 2 complementary, rather than antagonistic or curvilinear, engagement-fostering aspects of teachers' instructional styles and, second, the somewhat different results obtained for the behavioral versus self-report measures of students' classroom engagement.

By manipulating the opportunity to choose between tasks of equal difficulty, throughout the motivational process, the effect of autonomy support was examined both behaviorally and electrophysiologically. More negative stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and an enlarged FRN loss–win difference wave (d-FRN) indicated an enhanced expectation toward the positive outcome (during the anticipation stage) as well as intensified intrinsic motivation toward the task (during the outcome appraisal stage) when choice was available. Taken together, results of the present study suggest d-FRN upon feedback as a real-time electrophysiological indicator of intrinsic/autonomous motivation and illustrate the important role of autonomy-supportive job design in the workplace.},

	abstract = {The goals of this study were to extend the literature about classroom autonomy in several ways. First, since previous research on autonomy has tended to focus on younger learners, we examined whether the positive effects of autonomy on motivation and performance would be replicated in a college sample. Second, we tested to see whether the well-established links between intrinsic motivation and autonomy would also be found using motivational constructs that play key roles in learning (specifically, task value, self-efficacy, and test anxiety). Third, we sought to trace the effect of autonomy on changes in student motivation over the course of a semester. Finally, we examined the role of autonomy on course performance. We found that experiences of classroom autonomy in the college classroom were more closely related to motivational factors than to performance. While the immediate experience of autonomy may not be directly facilitative of high course grades, autonomy does seem to foster intrinsic goal orientation, task value, and self-efficacy, all of which are critical components of “continuing motivation.” The data presented here lend further support for the benefits of fostering autonomy within academic settings.},

Subsequent analyses suggested that students’ autonomy need satisfaction was greatest when they perceived that teachers also identified the importance and usefulness of coursework and considered students’ interests and opinions in course activities. Provision of choice and perspective-taking related to greater course value through autonomy need satisfaction, while identifying the importance and usefulness of course activities had only direct positive effects on course value. The pattern of total, direct, and indirect effects was slightly different depending on the component of course value.

	abstract = {An inherent aspect of learner-controlled instructional environments is the ability of learners to affect the degree of difficulty faced during training. However, research has yet to examine how learner-controlled practice difficulty affects learning. Based on the notion of desirable difficulties (Bjork, 1994), this study examined the cognitive and motivational antecedents and outcomes of learner-controlled practice difficulty in relation to learning a complex task. Using a complex videogame involving both strong cognitive and psychomotor demands, 112 young adult males were given control over their practice difficulty, which was reflected in the complexity of the training task. Results show that general mental ability, prior experience, pre-training self-efficacy, and error encouragement were positively related to learner-controlled practice difficulty. In turn, practice difficulty was directly related to task knowledge and post-training performance, and it was related to adaptive performance through the mediating influences of task knowledge and post-training performance. In general, this study supports the notion that training difficulty operationalized in terms of task complexity is positively related to both knowledge and performance outcomes. Results are discussed with respect to the need for more research examining how task complexity and other forms of difficulty could be leveraged to advance learner-controlled instructional practices.

Previous research that focuses on how students perceive these learning environments usually does not take the differential impact of students’ study motivation into account. However, the type of motivation might influence how students perceive their learning environment. To this end, this study investigates the relationship between students’ perceived autonomy support in student-centred learning environments and self-regulation and self-efficacy by taking study motivation into account. The results indicate that autonomy-supportive teacher behaviour enhances self-efficacy for students who are autonomously motivated. Amotivated students might need other than autonomy-supportive teacher behaviour to develop self-efficacy. Self-regulation seems to play a less distinct role. Overall, when examining the effects of autonomy-supportive teaching in higher education, the quality and quantity of students’ motivation has a role to play, an aspect which is important to consider in future research and practice.},
