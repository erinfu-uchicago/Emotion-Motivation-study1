# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Participants
### Phrase 1  
The recruit goal for phrase one is 100 participants. _Qualtrics_ is used to conduct the recruitment ([https://www.qualtrics.com/](url)).  
There are three *exclusive conditions* for participants:  
* Condition 1  
* Condition 2  
  * Sub-Condition 2.1  
  * Sub-Condition 2.2  
* Condition 3  

### Phrase 2
The recruit goal for phrase two is 20 participants.  
**List of dataset**  
1. Dataset 1  
2. Dataset 2  
3. Dataset 3  
The dataset were saved by **_Google Drive_**.
